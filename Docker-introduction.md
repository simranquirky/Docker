# Let’s discuss in Detail- What is Docker?
Common questions that might be occupying your mind.. What is Docker? Why is it so talked about,in the technoligical world? Was Docker a miracle ??
Docker is the technology that gave a huge transform to the IT Industry.In 2-3 years of its arrival everyone started using it, from all domains ranging from telecom to banking, consultancies, products etc.

Let’s start from basics!
If we want to run any program we need Operating System, there is no such way invented yet where we can run our program without OS.
And without running any program you cannot do anything in your operating system.
To make the above statement clear, lets take an example , you open your computer, drag the mouse, you are able to drag the mouse only beacuse a program is running in the backend, or say you type something , again the same thing you are able to type because some sort of program is running in the backend. It means, if you have RAM, CPU , harddisk, or any hardware you can use them only by running some program.
and for any program to run we need OS, and without program user cannot do any thing.

So for running any program or making use of any hardware devices you need to install OS. We all know that normal installation of any OS be it Mac or Windows or any other OS, it takes approximately 30 minutes or even more. After that you need to boot your OS and then login to your system to start working.

This involves a lot of time.

Now you may comeup with the question that we need to install the OS only once, or maybe when it crashes due to some reason a few more times in our lifetime, and it may not be so much a headache. In that case Why is Docker an extraordinary Technology?
Well I am here to answer.

# What are the benefits of Docker?
Knowing the issue is really important to know why Docker is so helpful.

There are many sectors of the IT industry where we need to install the OS , run programs on the OS and then terminate it. This cycle continues almost daily in such sectors like the testing sectors. Here they waste a lot of time, and the companies have to pay for approximately 30 minutes a day, which roughly means 15 hours of no service each month to their employees.

This is a loss for the company since they loose time as well as they have to pay for nothing. And in this age of competition some amount of delay may kick you out of the market. so the faster you work on your projects and come up with new technology the better it is.
And for such competition this kind of delay is not acceptable.

# Docker- the solution to a major problem
Now these are ths issues. after this if someone comes to you and says I will provide you with a tool which will help you to lunch your OS would not that be miracle? The enitre process of installation, booting and logging into the system takes 1 second.Yes and exactly this is the Miracle!

Docker the Miracle!!
